			<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
			<p>Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The basic premise of machine learning is to build algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output while updating outputs as new data becomes available.</p>

			<h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
			<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It involves developing algorithms that can process and analyze natural language data, allowing computers to understand and interpret human language in a useful way.</p>

			<h2>Computer Vision</h2>
			<p>Computer vision is a field of study focused on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. It involves the development of algorithms and techniques that can help machines recognize and understand objects, scenes, and activities in images and videos.</p>
